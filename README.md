## What is DartLab?

DartLab is a Python library for parsing and analyzing [DART (Data Analysis, Retrieval and Transfer System)](https://dart.fss.or.kr/) — Korea's official electronic disclosure system. It extracts **both financial numbers and narrative text** from corporate filings.

All data is accessed through simple properties on a `Company` object, following the yfinance-style API.

## Installation

> **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** is required — a fast Python package manager written in Rust. It handles Python version management and virtual environments automatically.

```bash
# 1. Install uv (skip if already installed)
# Windows (PowerShell)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
# macOS / Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# 2. Create a project
uv init my-analysis && cd my-analysis

# 3. Install DartLab — pick the extras you need
uv add dartlab              # Core (financial statement parsing)
uv add dartlab[ai]          # + AI analysis web interface (dartlab ai)
uv add dartlab[llm]         # + OpenAI/Ollama LLM (CLI analysis)
uv add dartlab[charts]      # + Plotly charts
uv add dartlab[all]         # Everything

# 4. Verify
uv run python -c "from dartlab import Company; print(Company('005930').corpName)"
# → 삼성전자

# 5. Launch AI analysis (requires dartlab[ai])
uv run dartlab ai
# → http://localhost:8400
```

## Quick Start

```python
from dartlab import Company

c = Company("005930")       # by stock code
c = Company("삼성전자")      # by company name (Korean)
c.corpName                   # "삼성전자"
```

Creating a `Company` object prints a usage guide. For the full guide, call `c.guide()`.

Data is auto-downloaded from GitHub Releases when not found locally.

```python
from dartlab.core.dataLoader import downloadAll

downloadAll("docs")                        # 260+ companies — disclosure documents
downloadAll("finance")                     # 2,700+ companies — financial numbers
downloadAll("report")                      # 2,700+ companies — periodic reports
downloadAll("finance", forceUpdate=True)   # re-download if remote is newer
```

## Features

### Financial Statements

```python
c.BS    # Balance Sheet (DataFrame)
c.IS    # Income Statement (DataFrame)
c.CF    # Cash Flow Statement (DataFrame)
```

### Cross-Company Comparable Time Series

OpenDART financial data is mapped to standardized accounts, enabling **cross-company quarterly time series**.

```python
series, periods = c.timeseries
# periods = ["2016_Q1", "2016_Q2", ..., "2024_Q4"]
# series["IS"]["revenue"]            # quarterly revenue
# series["BS"]["total_assets"]       # quarterly total assets
# series["CF"]["operating_cashflow"] # quarterly operating cash flow

r = c.ratios
r.roe               # 8.29 (%)
r.operatingMargin   # 9.51 (%)
r.debtRatio         # 27.4 (%)
r.fcf               # Free Cash Flow (KRW)
```

2,700+ listed companies are normalized to the same snakeId schema, making any pair of companies directly comparable.

### Summary Financials with Bridge Matching

Extracts summary financial time series, automatically tracking accounts even when names change due to K-IFRS revisions.

```python
result = c.fsSummary()

result.FS          # Full financial time series (Polars DataFrame)
result.BS          # Balance Sheet
result.IS          # Income Statement

## AI Analysis (dartlab ai)

Chat with an LLM over DartLab's structured data to analyze companies interactively — `uv run dartlab ai` opens the web UI at `http://localhost:8400`.

All extracted data (financial statements, notes, dividends, executives, governance) is provided as context for natural-language Q&A with streaming responses.

> **Currently supported LLM: Ollama (local)**
>
> The current version supports **Ollama** for local LLM inference. No API key needed, and your data stays on your machine.
>
> - Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download), then `ollama pull gemma3` to download a model
> - Select and download models in the UI settings
> - GPU (NVIDIA/AMD) is auto-detected for acceleration
>
> **Coming soon**: Cloud LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

---

## Bulk Extraction

```python
d = c.all()    # All module data as dict (with progress bar)
# {"BS": df, "IS": df, "CF": df, "dividend": df, "notes": {...},
#  "timeseries": (series, periods), "ratios": RatioResult, ...}
```

```python
import dartlab
dartlab.verbose = False    # Suppress progress output

d = c.all()    # Silent extraction
```

---

## Result Object

Properties return the primary DataFrame. For the full Result object, use `c.get()`.

```python
# property — returns DataFrame directly
c.audit          # opinionDf (audit opinion DataFrame)

# get() — returns full Result object
result = c.get("audit")
result.opinionDf   # Audit opinion
result.feeDf       # Audit fees
```

---

## Company Search

```python
from dartlab import Company

Company.search("삼성")
# ┌──────────────┬──────────┬────────────────┐
# │ 회사명       ┆ 종목코드 ┆ 업종           │
# └──────────────┴──────────┴────────────────┘

Company.listing()   # Full KRX listed companies
Company.status()    # Local data index
c.docs()            # Filing list + DART viewer links
```

## Core Technology

### Horizontal Alignment of Filings

DART filings cover different periods depending on report type:

```
                           Q1         Q2         Q3         Q4
                          ┌──────┐
 Q1 Report                │  Q1  │
                          └──────┘
                          ┌──────────────┐
 Semi-Annual              │   Q1 + Q2    │
                          └──────────────┘
                          ┌─────────────────────┐
 Q3 Report                │    Q1 + Q2 + Q3     │
                          └─────────────────────┘
                          ┌──────────────────────────────┐
 Annual Report            │       Q1 + Q2 + Q3 + Q4      │
                          └──────────────────────────────┘
```

Q1 reports contain only Q1, semi-annual reports contain cumulative Q1+Q2, and annual reports contain the full year. DartLab reverse-engineers standalone quarterly figures from these cumulative structures, and tracks accounts even when names change between filings.

### Bridge Matching

K-IFRS revisions and internal restructuring frequently cause **account name changes within the same company**. Bridge Matching combines amount matching and name similarity across adjacent years to automatically link identical accounts.

```
             2022              2023              2024
             ──────            ──────            ──────
 매출액 ────────────── 매출액 ────────────── 수익(매출액)
                              ↑ name change              ↑ name change
 영업이익 ──────────── 영업이익 ──────────── 영업이익
 당기순이익 ────────── 당기순이익 ────────── 당기순이익(손실)
```

Four-stage matching process:

1. **Exact match** — identical amounts
2. **Restatement match** — within 0.5 tolerance
3. **Name change match** — amount error < 5% AND name similarity > 60%
4. **Special item match** — decimal-unit items like EPS

When match rate drops below 85%, a breakpoint is detected and the segment is split.

## Data

### Sources and Integrity

All data originates from **[OpenDART](https://opendart.fss.or.kr/)** and **[DART](https://dart.fss.or.kr/)**, Korea's official electronic disclosure system. The developer has **not modified a single number** — only metadata columns (stock code, year, report type, etc.) have been added for structural organization.

If you want to verify, you can cross-check any value against the original filings using the package's built-in DART viewer links (`c.docs()`).

Each Parquet file contains all filings for a single company:

- **Metadata**: stock code, company name, report type, filing date, business year
- **Quantitative**: summary financials, financial statement body, notes
- **Narrative**: business description, audit opinion, risk management, executive/shareholder status

### Data Releases

| Category | Release Tags | Description | Count |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Disclosure | [`data-docs`](https://github.com/eddmpython/dartlab/releases/tag/data-docs) | Parsed annual report sections | 260+ |
| Finance | [`data-finance-1`](https://github.com/eddmpython/dartlab/releases/tag/data-finance-1) [`2`](https://github.com/eddmpython/dartlab/releases/tag/data-finance-2) [`3`](https://github.com/eddmpython/dartlab/releases/tag/data-finance-3) [`4`](https://github.com/eddmpython/dartlab/releases/tag/data-finance-4) | XBRL financial statement numbers | 2,700+ |
| Report | [`data-report-1`](https://github.com/eddmpython/dartlab/releases/tag/data-report-1) [`2`](https://github.com/eddmpython/dartlab/releases/tag/data-report-2) [`3`](https://github.com/eddmpython/dartlab/releases/tag/data-report-3) [`4`](https://github.com/eddmpython/dartlab/releases/tag/data-report-4) | Periodic report data | 2,700+ |

Finance and Report data are split into 4 tags by stock code range (GitHub's 1000-asset-per-release limit). `loadData()` and `downloadAll()` handle this automatically.

### Bring Your Own Data

If you structure your own Parquet files to match DartLab's schema, all existing features work out of the box. Place files as `data/{category}/{stockCode}.parquet` and every property, extraction module, and analysis tool will function normally.

### Disclaimer

This project is licensed under MIT. While the data faithfully mirrors OpenDART public disclosures, **no guarantee of commercial reliability is provided**. Always verify against official sources for investment or compliance decisions.

> **Update frequency**
>
> Data is collected directly without paid proxies, so updates may be slow. Adding new companies or reflecting the latest filings may take time.

## Why DartLab?

DART filings contain far more than financial numbers — business descriptions, risk factors, audit opinions, litigation status, and governance changes are all embedded in the text. Most tools only extract the numbers. The rest is discarded.

DartLab extracts both. It aligns quarterly, semi-annual, and annual reports on a single time axis, and automatically tracks accounts even when K-IFRS revisions or restructuring changes their names.

> **Current scope**
>
> Bridge Matching tracks account name changes **within a single company** across years. The finance engine enables **cross-company comparison** by mapping XBRL accounts to standardized snakeIds. 2,700+ listed companies are normalized to the same structure.
>
> The insight engine grades each company across 7 areas (performance, profitability, financial health, cash flow, governance, risk), detects anomalies, and the rank engine computes market-wide size rankings.
>
> Text analysis capabilities are being developed in a **separate project** and will be integrated into DartLab.
>
> The ultimate goal is a tool that can analyze the **entire market** at once, not just one company.
